% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)




% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % The IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/acronym


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdwtools


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eqparbox




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thumbpdf


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.

%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,breaklinks=true,dvips]{hyperref}
%\usepackage{breakurl}
%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\begin{abstract}
Since the 1980's, the RSA Encryption algorithm has been used as a near foolproof method of encrypting sensitive data sent over the Internet. It relies on the relatively slow computing power of modern day computers as well as prime factorization being an NP-complete math problem . However, with quantum computers on the horizon of being invented, many cryptologists worry about the safety of encrypted data. Furthermore, many unsolved math problems are so because of their difficulty to solve them with current computational methods. This paper analyzes why the safety of encryption has both increased and decreased over the age of computers, as well as the effects of quantum computing on unsolved math problems.

\IEEEPARstart{I}{n} 1955, mathematician John Nash penned a letter to the National Security Agency that would change the face of computing forever. TODO add citation
%https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/nash-letters/assets/files/nash_letters1.pdf. 
In this letter, he presented a theory about the computational power required to find the solutions to various mathematical problems. In particular, he focused on the art of cryptography, and the length of time necessary to crack an encryption. Up to that point, computer scientists who created algorithms concentrated solely on the required time to solve a particular length of problem. Nash suggested that instead of fixating on the length of time necessary to solve a problem of a particular length, scientists should consider the rate of difficulty growth of the problem resolution time given the length of the inputs grew at a linear rate. Furthermore, in lieu of computation ti me, a scientist should focus on the number of computational steps required to solve the problem. A computational step is the number of state changes that the machine processes  in carrying out the set of steps to solve the problem. The shape of this growth curve would help classify the difficulty of the problem. For example, the addition of numbers is a problem with a characteristic of linear growth. Doubling the number of digits to be added results in approximately double the computation time. Therefore, these problems grow at a linear rate\footnote{Linear growth is still technically considered a polynomial growth of the form $n^k$ with $k=0$.}.  However, problems such as multiplication grow at a slightly faster pace. Doubling the length of the inputs results in a growth of $2^2$ times the number of computational steps. Tripling the length of the input  results in a growth of $3^2$ times the number of computational steps. This growth may be somewhat rapid, but can be expressed as a polynomial\footnote{A polynomial is an expression that can be written in the form $a_{n}x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dotsb +a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}$ }. The exponent of the growth rate is always constant. Polynomial growth can therefore be displayed as some combination of terms in the form $n^k$, where n is a variable and $k$ is a constant.

Another type of problem is anything similar to cracking a password by brute force. For simplicity sake, assume the password is a PIN composed only of digits 0-9. In the worst case scenario, for a 1 digit PIN, the computer would take $10^1=10$ guesses. For a 2 digit PIN, the computer would take $10^2 = 100$ guesses. For a 4 digit pin, the computer would take $10^4=10\,000$ guesses. This is growing at a rate of $10^k$, where k is some constant. This growth pattern is known as exponential growth, where the variable is in the exponent. The resultant curve is extremely sharp. For context, if a password was able to consist of any numbers, letters, or special characters on a standard US keyboard, with only an eight character password, the number of computational steps required skyrockets up to $82^8$, or 2 with fifteen zeros following it. 

\subsection{Classifying P and NP Problems}
Mathematicians had been noticing problems with similar growth patterns in all different fields of math and science. So, they decided to classify these problems.

\subsubsection{P-Type problems} The first type is known as a problem with difficulty P. To find the largest number in a list of numbers, a computer must iterate through each element in the list of numbers one time\footnote{For each element in the list, check if it's larger than the previous element. If it is, store that value as the largest value.}. Assume this uses $n$ computational steps. If the length of the list is doubled, the computer must go through $2n$ steps, or double the number of steps, in order to determine the largest element in the list. Tripling the length results in $3n$ computational steps. Therefore, increasing the list from $n$ elements to $k\cdot n $ elements will result in having to use $k$ times the number of computational steps\footnote{A sample Python script that does this calculation is in Appendix A.}. This increase results in a linear growth. By computer standards, this is considered a slow growth. Mathemeticians decided to classify these problems as type P problems, as they could be solved in  \textbf{P}olynomial time. Not only are these problems easy to solve, but they are also easy to confirm if a potential solution is correct. 

\subsubsection{NP-type Problems}
 ``Nondeterministic Polynomial time problems'' (also known as NP problems) are not only difficult to solve, but also easy to check a solution to in polynomial time\footnote{``Easy'' and ``difficult'' in this case mean that they are respectively solvable and not solvable by a computer in a reasonable amount of time.}. One of the most common examples of an NP problem is finding a subset of a list that satisfies a given requirement. This is often referred to as the hackey-sack problem. If someone is presented with a collection of small sacks with specified random weights, and then asked to find a subset of those sacks that result in a given weight, the only way to approach this problem with current computational methods is a brute force algorithm, guessing a random subset, and checking the result. Unlike the P-type problem of finding the largest number in a list, the number of computational steps required for this problem results in a much faster growth. Assume that initially, just 2 sacks are given. Call these $c_1$ and $c_2$. To figure out which combination yields the correct answer, one must try the following combinations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $c_1$
	\item $c_2$
	\item $c_1+c_2$
\end{itemize}
This is only 3 iterations, which isn't terrible. Mathematically, the number of iterations required can be represented with the following expression, where $r$ is the number of sacks in the initial collection. $$\sum_{k=1}^{r} \Comb{r}{k} $$ 

However, the number of computational steps in this problem grows at an extremely fast rate. For 4 sacks in the initial collection, the number of iterations required jumps to $\sum_{k=1}^{4} \Comb{4}{k} = 15$. Doubling the length of the input quintupled the number of computational steps. Through the use of Pascal's Triangle, one can find that the required number of computational steps for an initial collection of $k$ sacks is $2^k-1$. For an idea of the rate of growth, a collection of 30 sacks would require over 1 billion computational steps. \\

Yet another example of an NP problem is the factoring of a number into its prime factors. In his 1801 book \textit{Disquisitiones Arithmeticae}, mathematician Frederick Gauss proved that any number has exactly 1 prime factorization. It is extremely easy to check if a given factorization for a number is correct (the multiplication of said numbers is a P-difficulty problem). However, in order to find the unique factorization for a number, the only method currently known is guessing and checking every single factor for that number. As the length of the target number grows, so does the length of computation time, but the computation time grows exponentially. As the growth of computation time is not of a polynomial form, the factorization problem is considered an NP-difficulty problem. But what application does this have in the real world?

\subsection{RSA Encryption}
As a shopper enters their credit card details for an online store website, the shopper is assured that their credit card details and other personal data are protected if the green lock icon is present in their browser. Less known is the fact that the only reason this lock icon has any significant value is thanks to two major factors: 1, Prime factorization is classified as an NP problem, and 2, the difficulty of breaking RSA encryption is extremely difficult and time consuming using current computation methods. In 1978, three computer scientists, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, publicly released an encryption algorithm titled after their names, RSA. The basis of this encryption technique\footnote{Please note that this is a highly simplified explanation of the encryption algorithm. To describe this in full detail would take far more in-depth explanations and mathematics than would be appropriate for this paper.} is two secret prime numbers (known as private keys) multiplied together to form a public key. To decrypt the message, the two original numbers must be known. Finding these original two numbers is only possible through repetitive brute force calculations\footnote{Although  some algorithms (such as Shour's Algorithm) exist to reduce the work slightly using methods to eliminate groups of guesses, it is still a polynomial reduction on an exponential growth, which means the reduction is almost unnoticeable.}. For an idea of the size of these numbers, the public key length for most banking systems nowadays is over six hundred digits long\footnote{A 617 digit long public key is the key length for 2048 bit encryption.}. To complete these calculations with current  methods and computing technologies  would require somewhere on the order of 6.4 quadrillion years to try all possible combinations. 

\subsection{Evolution of Computational Methods}
 The phrase ``with current methods'' is used throughout this paper, in the context of methods used to solve a problem. This aligns with a computing device known as a Turing computer to solve a problem.  In 1936, English computer scientist and cryptologist Alan Turing proposed the idea of a theoretical computing machine that operates off of a memory tape with infinite length divided into discrete cells. Each cell contains a basic instruction. The reading head above the tape identifies the value of the cell on the memory tape, then moves the tape either to the left, to the right, or terminates the program. Although this may seem very simple, determining if an algorithm can be run on a Turing machine constitutes one of the most important problems in the field of computer science. A Turing computer is the most basic computer possible, taking in bits one at a time, and outputting a result based on the bit.  These computers are powerful. However, they are insufficient for solving NP problems. Because the difficulty and number of computational steps for NP-type problems grows with non-polynomial growth, the computation time grows rapidly to an unmanageable amount. However, this challenge will change with the introduction of quantum computers. 

Computers have evolved drastically over the decades. In first generation computers, or computer technology designed from 1939 to 1954, computers operated on vaccuum tubes. Even a basic computer with hardware specifications orders of magnitude weaker than a modern day pocket calculator would occupy an entire room, and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
%TODO add citation http://homepage.cs.uri.edu/faculty/wolfe/book/Readings/Reading03.htm
%ELI5 https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2ax3k3/eli5_how_does_a_computer_actually_work_like_how/
These vacuum tubes, due to the excess heat they created, were extremely unreliable and were prone to failure every few hours. Computers soon transitioned to using transistors, micro-switches that can read either 1 (for on) or 0  (for off). They will exist in exactly one of these states at any given time. One transistor by itself cannot do much. However, combining the transistors can result in extremely powerful calculations. There are 7 base combinations of transistors: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR and XNOR.  For an AND gate, the input is a pair of bits, and the output is a single bit. When both input bits are on, the output is is on, but otherwise, the output is off. For a NOT gate, the input is a single bit and the output is also a single bit. The output is simply the opposite of the input. The output is simply the opposite of the input. By placing a NOT gate on the output of an AND gate, a NAND gate is formed, which outputs the opposite of the AND gate. Another type of gate is the OR gate. This has 2 inputs and 1 output. If either of the inputs is true, or both are true, the output is true. Only if both are false is the output false. 
%Source http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/logic/logic_5.html
This NAND gate forms a series of logical outputs known as a truth table. In plain English, the NAND gate says "If either A or B are NOT true, then Q is true". The combination of these logical gates results in very low level instructions, such as STORE, LOAD, ADD, or COMPARE. These instructions can be used to address the data stored in RAM. The language used for these instructions is called `assembly language' or `machine code'\footnote{This language is referred to as a low-level language, while more common languages like Python, FORTRAN, C/C++, and Java are referred to as high-level languages. This refers to the logical distance between the syntax of the language and the machine language, along with the amount of abstraction used in the language.}. Compared to the vacuum tubes, transistors could be packed far more densely into the same area. Due to Moore's law \footnote{Moore's law is based off of Intel co-founder Gordon Moore's observation that the density of transistors on microprocessors had approximately doubled every year since the early age of computers. Moore's law states that this trend will continue every year into the future.}, the processing power of computers grows at an exponential rate. Eventually, transistors were changed to a special type of transistor known as a MOSFET\footnote{Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors}. Due to their low power usage, MOSFET's could be packed into extreme densities. Eventually, these transistors were integrated into the layers of silicon in the processing chip, which allowed the size of an individual transistor to be in the tens of nanometers\footnote{For example, the Intel i7 Quad Core CPU packs 731 million transistors into a board only 0.63'' by 0.63''.}
%Source for i7 density: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/upgrade-repair-pc,3000-2.html
However, regular computers are soon reaching the limit of how small these transistors can get. Current CPU architecture is based off of 14 nanometer transistors TODO cite. The next generation of transistors will reach 10 nanometers. Computer scientists predict that transistors will reach their physical limit size sometime in the mid 2020's. This limit is due to the fact that the transistors are approaching the size of atoms. TODO CITE

%Quantum computers were first suggested in 1981 by quantum physicist Richard Feynman, at a conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology about computational physics. 
A quantum computer operates uses a slightly different principle. Instead of operating on a physical piece of hardware (the transistor) that produces a bit, it operates by observation of a photon that represents a qubit\footnote{Qubit is a juxtaposition of QUantum BIT}. A qubit is a special type of bit that can either represent a 1, a 0, or a superposition of a 1 and a 0. But how can something exist in both a 1 and a 0 at the same time? To understand this, one must first understand the principle behind Schr\"{o}dinger’s cat. 


The infamous Schr\"{o}dinger's cat experiment is performed as follows. Imagine a living cat inside a sealed bunker, with a sealed beaker of poisonous material, a Geiger counter attached to a hammer, and a small piece of radioactive material. The radioactive material has a 50\% chance of having one of its atoms decay in the next hour (which would set off the Geiger counter, smashing the hammer into the vial of gas and releasing it into the bunker, killing the cat). As long as the bunker is sealed and unobserved, the cat has a 50\% chance of being dead and a 50\% chance of being alive. When the bunker is opened, however, the cat must either be dead or alive. The instant before the bunker is opened, the cat exists in a quantum superposition of both dead and alive. 

Just like the cat, as long as the qubit is unobserved, it exists in a quantum superposition both a 1 and a 0. As soon as the qubit is observed, though, it ``snaps'' to either a 1 or a 0. Another way of thinking about this is like a coin that is flipped and is  spinning in midair. At any point in the air, it is impossible to figure out if it is heads or tails. However, smashing a fist down on top of the coin will force it to go to either a heads or a tails orientation. TODO explain this better. But how does this help a quantum computer work faster than a regular computer?

\subsection{How a Quantum Computer can solve NP-type problems}

The operations of a computer can be compared to an office worker sitting at their desk. The storage (hard drive) is comparable to a file cabinet for long term storage. The Random Access Memory (RAM, also known as memory) is comparable to the top of the desk, where papers can be placed when they are being worked on. Finally, the CPU is comparable to the person sitting at the desk, actually performing the tasks. The person can only work on something on the top of their desk, as trying to read a piece of paper sitting in a file cabinet would be awkward and slow\footnote{Interestingly enough, trying to work on a paper while the paper is still in the file cabinet can be compared to a pagefile, where the CPU pulls data directly from storage.}. Therefore, the person pulls an item out of their file cabinet and places it on their desk. The desk can only hold so many papers, so when the desk runs out of room, some papers have to be put back into the file storage. 

%Source
%http://www.explainthatstuff.com/quantum-computing.html


Similiarly to the desk analogy, a CPU instructs the hard drive to load certain pieces of information from the hard drive into the RAM. When the computer runs out of free memory, the CPU removes information from the RAM that isn't being used. Unlike the desk analogy, however, the CPU does not directly operate from the RAM. Instead, the CPU loads a small bit of information from the RAM into the register of the CPU. The register is a very small amount of extremely fast storage directly tied to the CPU. For example, an Intel i7 CPU has 64 bit, 80 bit, and 120 bit registers\footnote{Compare these sizes to the RAM in an average desktop, which is measured in gigabytes.}. Once in the register, the bits go through the transistors discussed earlier, where the logical gates perform instructions based on the data going through them. 

%TODO CITE
%SOURCE http://www.thphys.nuim.ie/staff/joost/TQM/QvC.html

A classical computers ``bits'' can either store a 1 or a 0. This is relatively efficient, but storing an N-bit number requires N bits. In other words, storing a 64 bit value takes 64 bits, and storing a 256 bit value takes 256 bits. The transistors in the CPU only recognize the 2 states, and operate serially (in series) on each bit. 

A quantum computer, on the other hand, uses bits that exist in a state that is either a $|1\}$, $|0\}$, or a superposition that can be represented with the expression $a|1\} + b|0\}$. The state of the bit can be expressed using complex vector addition. However, due to a quantum theory known as quantum entanglement, the state of 1 qubit affects the other qubits in the system. Two particles can be entangled even if they are separated by physical space. A very critical point about this: quantum computers do not measure the values of the individial qubits. Instead, they measure the `correlations', or interactions, between the qubits. Just like Schr\"{o}dinger's cat, as soon as the qubits themselves are observed, the system changes from its original state. The cutting link to success came when two computers scientists, David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa, determined an algorithm that allowed for a computer to deduce what the original state of the qubits was most likely to have been before observation. Think of it like a house of cards that cannot be observed without them falling into a pile. The Jozsa-Deutsch algorithm allows for a comupter to determine the most likely original state of the cards. 

%Algorithm link https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/deutsch-jozsa-algorithm

This ability is what makes a quantum computer so powerful. Instead of operating serially on a stream of bits, the computer can operate in parallel, on multiple bits simultaneously.

\section{Quantum Computing Pros and Cons}
What are the advantages and disadvantages that come with the rise of quantum computing?
\subsection{Advantages}
The United States Military expresses a large amount of interest in quantum computing, primarily for its use in cryptanalysis, or code-breaking. Because quantum computers can analyze large numbers of bits simultaneously, they are excellent for problems that require brute force calculations. 


Another use of quantum computing arises in the use of autonmous vehicles and route generation. Finding the shortest route between a set of points is considered an NP-hard problem
\footnote{See Appendix C }.
%http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TravelingSalesmanProblem.html
In math terms, this problem is attempting to find the most efficient Hamiltonian Cycle to take through a set of N nodes. This has a real life application, however; finding the shortest route between a set of points is nothing more than a navigation application such as Google Maps. The use of quantum computing in similar navigation apps would allow for more accurate calculations in arrival time, as well as more accurate methods of finding the fastest route possible. 
 
One highly important section of the field of quantum computing is its application in the field of artificial intelligence. According to IBM, "Making facets of artificial intelligence such as machine learning much more powerful when data sets are very large, such as in searching images or video." Machine learning such as IBM's Watson relies on searching a vast database of information to calculate results. Through the use of quantum computing, these database searches can be completed on orders of magnitude faster than would be possible with standard computing methods. TODO add citation
 %http://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/learn/quantum-computing-applications/

Yet another application that quantum computing will change dramatically is sociopoliticial and socioeconomic fields. In sociopolitical fields, especially when it comes to political elections, races are won largely through the use of algorithms to determine which groups of people stand the most chance of being swayed to vote for that particular party. Current algorithms, although they are relatively accurate, can only go so far in how accurate they can be. But with the use of quantum computing, algorithms can be made that will be able to precisely target groups. 

What about applications that could potentially save lives? Current meteorological prediction techniques
 TODO add more. 
\subsection{Disadvantages}
One of the largest problems with a quantum computer is that it is still not feasible. The power required to run the processor combined with the temperatures measured in milliKelvin to cool the hardware results in astronomical costs. Furthermore, the difficulty of actually setting up the hardware would be prodigiously difficult. 

What about encryption? RSA encryption relies on the fact that computers are unable to brute force calculate the private keys. If a quantum computer is produced by a malicious source, then the effects could be devastating. Private keys could be calculated almost instantaneously, allowing for hackers to have access to data that is thought to be private.

TODO keep expanding this. 


\section{Conclusion}
\IEEEPARstart{O}{n}ce a reliable quantum computer is available, the face of mathematics will be changed forever. Math and science problems that would not have been possible before will now be able to be accomplished in mere seconds.

\section{Proof of iteration count for sacks}
Start with a test case, then prove for a general solution. 
Let the number of sacks in the initial collection be $4$. 

To figure out the total possible number of sacks, use a case by case scenario. Every final count of sacks will either contain 1, 2, 3, or 4 sacks. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Case 1}, picking 4 sacks. \\
	There are 4 possible choices for the first sack, 3 possible for the second, 2 for the third, and 1 for the fourth. Mathematically represented, there are  $\Perm{4}{4} = 4! = 4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1$ possible combinations. However, as the order the sacks are picked in does not matter, divide by $4!$. The mathematical represenatation of this compensation is $\Comb{4}{4}$. $$\frac{4!}{4!} = 1$$. This makes sense, because there's only 1 way to pick a collection of all 4 sacks. 
	\item \textbf{Case 2}, picking 3 sacks.\\
	With the same logic as the previous case, there are  $\Perm{4}{3} = 4\cdot3\cdot2$  possible unordered combinations. However, each choice of 3 sacks can be arranged in $3!$ ways, so therefore divide the total number of collections $(4!)$ by the number of arrangements of each $(3!)$. $$\frac{4!}{3!} = \frac{24}{6} = 4$$.
	\item \textbf{Case 3}, picking 2 sacks.\\
	\[\Comb{4}{2} = \frac{\Perm{4}{2}}{2!} = 6\]
	\item \textbf{Case 4}, picking 1 sack.\\
	\[\Comb{4}{1} = \frac{\Perm{4}{1}}{1!} = 4\]
	Adding each of these together results in $1+4+6+4 = 15$. 
	
	The number of possible combinations for each case is not a random number. These numbers actually come from the Binomial Coefficients of Pascal's Triangle. 
	\begin{tabular}{rccccccccc}
		$n=0$:&    &    &    &    &  1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
		$n=1$:&    &    &    &  1 &    &  1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
		$n=2$:&    &    &  1 &    &  2 &    &  1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
		$n=3$:&    &  1 &    &  3 &    &  3 &    &  1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
		$n=4$:&  1 &    &  4 &    &  6 &    &  4 &    &  1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
	\end{tabular}
	
	The row $n=4$ has the same values as each of the cases discussed above. (The only number that does not show is the first 1, as this represents the number of ways to pick zero elements from the list of initial sacks. As this is not a valid solution to the problem, it is ignored.)
\end{itemize}

\section{Traveling Salesman NP Proof}
A simple explanation behind this statement: To find the shortest route between a set of nodes $N_1,N_2,\cdots N_Q$ of size Q, start at any node $N_1$. At this point, $Q$ guesses have been checked. Now, there are $Q-1$ points left to try. After another point $N_2$ has been selected, $Q(Q-1)$ guesses have been attempted. After another point, the number of guesses goes to $Q(Q-1)(Q-2)$. This is increasing at a rate of $Q!$, which is a non polynomial growth.
